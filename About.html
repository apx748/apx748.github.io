The idea for this club came up from a casual conversation. One of the co-founders had been going to a creative writing
meetup since two and half years. And when the other co-founder attended one meeting of the meetup, both of them
thought that there should be something similar at Northwestern catering to grad students and especially welcoming
non-creative writing majors and international graduate students. It was surprising that there were groups for dancing,
improv, public speaking but nothing similar existed for creative writing which catered to graduate students.

Graduate school can be very absorbing and we often don't find time to reflect or indulge our creative passions.
This gives an opportunity to take out time every two weeks and come together to write and share the stories.
