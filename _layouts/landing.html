						<span class="byline"><i>Do you like to write?  Do you like to be creative but find it challenging sometimes to put yourself on the page?  Do you enjoy receiving challenging prompts that spur your creativity?  The Northwestern Creative Writing group is a creative prompt group catering to Northwestern graduate students and designed to get you on the page and start the creative juices flowing.  Each meeting one member will act as the Prompt Master, offering a writing prompt like a picture, a first line, an object, or even a single word.  From these prompts members will write for fifteen to twenty minutes, creating a unique and original story, or perhaps creating something that will be the start of something bigger.  We offer positive comments and points for improvements on what our authors create, understanding that the writing generated within our group is rough or "first-draft".  We accept all members, from those who are serious about writing to those who use the time offered to blow off some creative steam. We welcome you, and hope you will join us soon.
 </i><br>
						<br>	We meet alternate Wednesdays from 7-9pm.</span>
