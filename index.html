				<span class="byline"> <i> From the prompts, members will write for <b><font color="purple">fifteen to twenty minutes</font></b>, creating a unique and original story, or perhaps creating something that will be the start of something bigger. We would be writing on 3 sets of prompts over the 120 minute period.<br>
					We offer positive comments and points for improvements on what our authors create, understanding that the writing generated within our group is <font color="purple">rough or "first-draft"</font>. <br>
					 We accept all members, from those who are serious about writing to those who use the time offered to blow off some creative steam. <br>
							We welcome you, and hope you will join us soon.

			<br>	We meet <b><font color="purple">alternate Wednesdays from 7-9 pm</font></b>. Next meeting scheduled for 8th March. </span>

We are open to changing the day, time and duration of the meeting. If you are interested and can't make it because of a conflict, please email us at apaulATUDOTNorthwesternDOTEDU.
