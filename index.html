					We offer positive comments and points for improvements on what our authors create, understanding that the writing generated within our group is <font color="purple">rough or "first-draft"</font>. <br>
					 We accept all members, from those who are serious about writing to those who use the time offered to blow off some creative steam. <br>
							We welcome you, and hope you will join us soon.
